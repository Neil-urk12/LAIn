# LAIn - AI Education Platform System Documentation

## Introduction

LAIn is a comprehensive AI education platform designed to democratize access to high-quality AI learning resources. The platform connects learners with structured AI courses, enabling them to acquire skills at their own pace through a user-friendly interface. LAIn aims to break down barriers to AI education and foster a supportive global community of AI enthusiasts and professionals.

The system provides course enrollment, progress tracking, certification, and administrative functionalities to create a complete learning ecosystem. Built with modern web technologies, LAIn offers a responsive and intuitive experience for learners, instructors, and administrators.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the LAIn platform are:

1. **Democratize AI Education**: Make high-quality AI learning resources accessible to a diverse global audience regardless of their background or prior experience.

2. **Provide Structured Learning Paths**: Offer carefully designed curricula that guide learners from foundational concepts to advanced AI applications.

3. **Enable Practical Application**: Incorporate hands-on projects and exercises that allow learners to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios.

4. **Foster Community Engagement**: Create a supportive environment where learners can connect, collaborate, and share knowledge.

5. **Ensure Learning Progress Tracking**: Provide tools for learners to monitor their progress and for instructors to assess student performance.

6. **Offer Certification**: Validate learners' achievements through verifiable certificates upon course completion.

7. **Facilitate Administrative Oversight**: Equip administrators with tools to manage users, courses, and platform performance.

## Scope

The LAIn platform encompasses the following core functionalities:

### User Management
- User registration and authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- User profile management
- Role-based access control (learner, instructor, admin)
- Session management and security features

### Course Management
- Course creation and editing
- Curriculum organization with lessons and modules
- Course enrollment and progress tracking
- Learning materials delivery

### Learning Experience
- Interactive lesson content
- Progress tracking with learning streaks
- Course completion and certification

### Administrative Functions
- User administration (view, edit, activate/deactivate)
- Course administration
- Platform analytics and reporting
- System settings management

### Security
- Encrypted data storage (using CryptoJS)
- Secure authentication with OTP and MFA
- Session monitoring and management

## Limitations

The current implementation of LAIn has the following limitations:

1. **Offline Access**: The platform requires an internet connection; offline learning capabilities are not currently supported.

2. **Content Creation Tools**: While instructors can create courses, the platform lacks advanced content creation tools for interactive simulations or AI model experimentation.

3. **Real-time Collaboration**: The system does not currently support real-time collaboration features between learners.

4. **Mobile Experience**: While responsive, the platform is primarily designed for desktop use; dedicated mobile applications are not available.

5. **Advanced Analytics**: The analytics capabilities are basic and do not include advanced learning analytics or predictive models for personalized learning paths.

6. **Integration Capabilities**: Limited integration with external learning management systems or enterprise HR systems.

7. **Scalability**: The current architecture may require optimization for very large user bases or high concurrent usage.

## Tech Stack

LAIn is built using modern web technologies:

### Frontend
- **Vue 3**: Core framework using the Composition API for reactive UI components
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code and improved developer experience
- **Pinia**: State management for Vue applications
- **Vue Router**: Client-side routing
- **Lucide Icons**: Modern icon set for the UI
- **CryptoJS**: For client-side encryption/decryption

### Backend
- **PocketBase**: Backend service for database operations, authentication, and file storage
- **Go**: Used in PocketBase's underlying architecture
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for persistent data storage

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Vitest**: Unit testing framework
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Vercel**: Hosting and deployment platform
- **Bun**: JavaScript runtime and package manager (alternative to Node.js/npm)

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Stores**: Pinia stores for state management (auth, admin, enrollment, settings)
- **Components**: Reusable Vue components organized by feature area
- **Models**: TypeScript interfaces defining data structures
- **Router**: Navigation configuration
- **Views**: Page-level components

This modern tech stack ensures a responsive, maintainable, and scalable application that can evolve with changing requirements and growing user base.
